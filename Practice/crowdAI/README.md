# Crowd AI
This program uses Torch to solve the [CrowdAI PlantVillage Disease
Classification Challenge](https://www.crowdai.org/challenges/1).

In this challenge, the disease of a plant is to be identified from an image of
its leaf.

This uses training of AlexNet ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional
Neural Networks.
